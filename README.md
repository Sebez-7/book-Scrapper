# Books Scraper

This Scrapy project scrapes the homepage of [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) and extracts the following data for each book:

- Book Title
- Book Price
- Stock Availability
- Rating (Star Level)
- Product Detail Link

The scraped data is saved into an Excel file (`books.xlsx`).
